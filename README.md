# Conversational AI Voice Analyst (Telegram Bot)

This repository contains the source code for a sophisticated Telegram bot that transforms audio and video files into intelligent, interactive conversations. The bot leverages a multi-stage processing pipeline, including speaker diarization and a stateful conversational agent built with **LangGraph** and powered by **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash**, to provide deep analysis of spoken content.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Multi-Format Support:** Processes both audio (`.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav`) and video (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.mov`) files seamlessly.
-   **Speaker Diarization:** Automatically identifies and labels different speakers in the conversation using the cutting-edge `pyannote.audio` library.
-   **Accurate Transcription:** Generates a full, time-stamped transcript and provides it as a downloadable `.srt` (subtitle) file.
-   **Stateful Conversational Memory:** Users can engage in a natural, context-aware dialogue about the transcript. The agent, built with **LangGraph**, remembers the conversation history for intelligent follow-up questions.
-   **Advanced AI Analysis:** Powered by a **LangGraph** agent and the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model, the bot can:
    -   Summarize long conversations or a specific speaker's points.
    -   Identify key topics, themes, and viewpoints.
    -   Answer specific questions about what each speaker said (e.g., "What was SPEAKER_01's opinion on the marketing strategy?").
    -   Extract insights and analyze the content beyond simple text retrieval.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & How It Works

The bot follows a robust, event-driven pipeline:

1.  **File Reception:** The user uploads an audio or video file to the Telegram bot.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Audio is extracted (if from video) and standardized into a 16kHz mono WAV format for optimal processing.
3.  **Speaker Diarization:** The `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` model processes the audio to determine *who* spoke and *when*.
4.  **Transcription (STT):** The audio is chunked based on speaker turns, and each segment is transcribed to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
5.  **Output Generation:** A complete transcript is assembled and also formatted into a `.srt` file, which is sent to the user.
6.  **Interactive Analysis:** The full transcript is loaded into the **LangGraph** agent's state as its "single source of truth." The user can then initiate a chat, where the Gemini model uses the transcript to answer questions. Each conversation is maintained in a persistent state using LangGraph's memory features.
